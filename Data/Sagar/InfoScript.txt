    with open('filename', 'a') as file

'r+': Read and write.
'b': Binary mode (e.g., 'rb', 'wb').

file.seek(offset, whence): Moves the file pointer to a specific position.

---------------Checking File Properties-----------

os.path.getsize(): Returns the size of the file in bytes

---------------Deleting or Renaming Files-----------
